# Feedback Analysis System

*(Deployed on PythonAnywhere · FastAPI · HTML · CSS)*

This project delivers a complete **web-based feedback analysis system** built using **FastAPI**, **Python**, **HTML**, and **CSS**. It is fully deployed on **PythonAnywhere**, providing a seamless online experience for processing uploaded text files and visualizing insights in real-time.

The system is designed to simplify the workflow of analyzing textual feedback by extracting meaningful patterns, computing sentiment indicators, and presenting results through dynamic visualizations—all within an elegant and user-friendly interface.

## 🌟 Overview

The application enables users to upload a plain text file containing multiple lines of feedback. Once uploaded, the system automatically:

* Processes and analyzes the textual content
* Extracts essential patterns and statistical indicators
* Computes an overall sentiment interpretation
* Generates a visual representation to support insights
* Displays all results directly on the same page for smooth interaction

No additional tools or installations are required—everything runs within the browser.
